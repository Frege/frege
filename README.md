What is Frege?
==============

Frege is a *pure* functional programming language in the spirit of Haskell.
It enjoys a strong static type system with powerful type inference and
[non-strict](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-strict_programming_language) - also known as _lazy_ - evaluation.

Frege programs are compiled to Java and run on the JVM.

The connection to Haskell is so strong that many users call it "_a_ Haskell for the JVM".

Motivation
----------
*For the Java programmer:* Frege offers you the opportunity to *learn and use a new programming paradigm*
that shines with
* a solid mathematical foundation,
* pure functions,
* immutability by default,
* side-effects only when declared,
* robustness under composition and concurrency,
* and a type system that is unparalleled on the JVM with its combination of power, simplicity and expressiveness.

You can still reuse your existing knowledge of the Java platform and its vast set of libraries.
Frege interoperates with Java such that you can easily call Frege from Java code and vice versa.
But unlike other approaches, calling Java from Frege doesn't undermine the language guarantees.

When calling Java from Frege, you have to declare the Java types in rigid Frege terms in order to
preserve the Frege language characteristics, especially purity, thread safety, and lazy evaluation.

Learning Frege essentially means that you will also learn Haskell and thus your effort pays of twice, since
you also get to know a very popular non-JVM language with 25+ years of development, a great community,
many (free) books, publications, tutorials, online courses, and considerable industry demand.


*For the Haskell programmer*: Frege gives you the opportunity to *use your skills on the JVM*.
Most idiomatic Haskell code will run in Frege unmodified or with only minimal, obvious adaptions.
Even more important: you can bring your purely functional problem solution strategies to your Java projects.

From now on you can also enjoy on the JVM:
* the terse Haskell syntax
* typeclasses
* powerful type inference
* higher rank types (type markers are required for those)
* lazy evaluation on infinite data structures
* functors, monoids, semigroups, monads, and all your other beloved mathematical abstractions.

There have been attempts to [port Haskell to the JVM](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/FAQ#Why_isn.27t_GHC_available_for_.NET_or_on_the_JVM.3F) before,
though said projects seem failed or stuck. The common wisdom suggests that it is not easily possible.

Frege is thought as a substitute for this missing GHC port. 
While not derived from any existing Haskell implementation, it is pretty much equivalent to Haskell 2010.
Please see the [wiki page that details the differences](https://github.com/Frege/frege/wiki/Differences-between-Frege-and-Haskell).

The Name
--------
The Frege programming language is named after and in honor of Gottlob Frege
who published the ideas of higher-order functions, partial function application, and many more concepts of formal logic
that we now take for granted back in the 19th century.

If you are curious how this name is pronounced, [you can use this translator page](http://translate.google.de/#de/en/Frege) to get it right.
Just click the audio symbol in the left (german) part.

Project State
-------------

The compiler, an Eclipse plugin and a provisional version of the documentation can be [downloaded](https://github.com/Frege/frege/releases). 
Note that Frege requires JDK 7 to compile and run programs.

The compiler and the documentation tool are quite stable, the documentation provisional and the library is evolving. 
It already supports important parts of the Haskell 2010 standard library.

See the [Getting Started](https://github.com/Frege/frege/wiki/Getting-Started) page for 
getting started at the command-line or read the [Eclipse plugin](https://github.com/Frege/eclipse-plugin) page.

There is also an [interpreter (REPL)](https://github.com/Frege/frege-repl). 
An online version of the REPL is available [here](http://try.frege-lang.org/).

The Frege standard library and the Frege compiler are themselves fully written in Frege.

Contributions
-------------

If you are interested in contributing, here are some hot topics:

* write Frege code to support more of the Java API
* port Haskell libraries or tools
* open issues on the Issues page if you find bugs, errors in documentation, etc.
* help make Frege popular by writing code for projects like Rosetta Stone or Computer Language Shootout.
* contribute to [Real World Frege](https://github.com/Dierk/Real_World_Frege/)
