    Problem: functions don't type check, because the higher ranked
    function argument gets stuffed into a tuple for pattern matching by desugaring.

    Desugaring can't make it right in the first place since there may be 
    constructors whose arity we don't know yet.

    Solution: Compile the tuple pattern matches *before* type checking.
