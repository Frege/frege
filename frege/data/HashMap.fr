    A HashMap implementation based on a 
    'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie Hash Array Mapped Trie'

    The hash array mapped trie achieves almost hash table-like speed 
    while using memory much more economically. 
    Also, a hash table may have to be periodically resized, 
    an expensive operation, whereas HAMTs grow and shrink dynamically.

    ## Creating Hash Maps

    Get an empty map with 'HashMap.mempty' or 'HashMap.empty', make a singleton one
    with 'singleton' or turn an association list into a 'HashMap' with 'fromList'.
    The more general function 'fromListWith' allows custom handling of 
    associations with duplicate keys.

    ## Add, Change or Remove Associations

    Use 'insert', 'delete', 'adjust' and 'replace'. The more general form of 'insert' 
    is 'insertWith' which accepts a function to combine the given value with an
    already existing one.

    ## Lookups

    The basic function is 'lookup', of which 'member' and 'lookupDefault' are variants.
    The operator ('!!') may be used when the existence of the keys looked for is out
    of the question.

    ## Set operations

    There is 'union', 'difference' and 'intersection'. More general functions 
    'unionWith' and 'intersectionWith' allow combination of the affected values.

    ## Folds

    Left folds as well as right folds are provided by 'foldValues' and 'foldrValues'. 
    Variants 'foldWithKey' and 'foldrWithKey' allow examination not only of the value, 
    but also of the key.

    Frequently needed functions such as 'values', 'keys', 'each' and 'size' are just
    predefined folds for your convenience.

    ## Filtering

    Create a subset of an existing map with 'filterValues' or 'filterWithKey'.

    ## Transformations

    'mapValues', 'mapWithKey' and 'traverseWithKey' should cover any need to 
    transform an existing map.

    ### Naming Conventions

    Functions whose name have the _With_ suffix take a custom function to combine two
    values and are thus more general than the ones without that suffix. 
    Most often it is the case that 
    > xxx = xxxWith const

    Functions whose name have the _Values_ suffix operate on the values of the mappings
    contained in the map and take an appropriate custom function as argument. 
    The _Values_ suffix also serves to avoid conflicts with
    Prelude functions (i.e. 'map', 'filter', 'fold', 'foldr').

    The companions of the _Values_ functions have the suffix _WithKey_ and accept 
    functions that take an extra argument for the key. The key portion of
    a mapping or association is always passed first, followed by the associated value.

    Less formally said, _k_ is associated with _v_ in the resulting map, updating
    a previously existing association of _k_ if it exists, while all other associations
    are left untouched.

    In the case of an update, the new value will get forced, see 'insertWith' for details.

{-- 
    _O(log n)_
    > insertWith f k v m
    If _m_ does not contain _k_, this works like 'insert'.
    Otherwise, the existing association of _k_ with some value _v'_ is replaced by
    an association of _k_ with the result of evaluating 
    > f v v'
    in the resulting map. 

    Strict evaluation is necessary to prevent building up of large thunks 
    of the form
    > f v3 (f v2 (f v1 v0))

    Note that
    > insert = insertWith const
    and that this will evaluate the *new* value in case of an update. If you
    want to prevent this, use

    > replace k v = insert k v . delete k
    
    The replaced value will be evaluated only if the given function is strict
    in the second argument. Since 'const' is lazy in the second argument, the
    following will be fine:
    
    > insert "foo" 7 (insert "foo" undefined (delete "foo" m))
    
    That is, the value that is inserted for a given key first is not evaluated on
    insertion, and only evaluated on update if the update function demands it, which
    is not the case for a plain 'insert'.

{--
    A map from hashable keys to values based on a Hash Mapped Array Trie.

    A map cannot contain duplicate keys; each key can map to at most one value. 
    A 'HashMap' makes no guarantees as to the order of its elements.

    A node of the 'HashMap' is either

        - a key/value pair
        - a list of key/value tuples with pair-wise different keys,
        where the hash code for all keys is identical (collisions). 
        In the (hopefully) unlikely case of such collisions,
        the performance of operations using the affected keys degrades to 
        that of similar operations on lists. 
        However, collision lists should be short, if occurring at all.
        - a bitmapped node with a bitmap of size 32 to indicate
        absence or presence of sub-nodes, followed by an array of up to 32
        (sub)nodes.
    
    This implementation of a
    'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure persistent' 
    hash array mapped trie uses 32 bit hash values as provided by Java and the
    Frege 'Eq' type class. 

    To find a value, the search starts with the root node.
    If the node is a key/value pair, the node's key is compared to the search key.
    When the keys are equal, the value is returned, otherwise the key is not in the map. 

    If the node is a bitmapped node, the hash code of the lookup key is computed 
    and the presence of the index provided by the last five bits is checked in the bitmap.
    If it is there, the search continues with the corresponding node 
    from the node array, otherwise the key is not in the map. With every recursion,
    the next five bits of the hash code will be used for indexing.

    It remains the case that the node is a collision list. The searched key's
    hashcode either is the same as the one of the keys in the collision list, 
    in which case the search degrades to a sequential search in that list, or it
    is different, and in the latter case we know that the key is not in the
    map without even touching the list.
    
    Hence, the worst case in searching must do the following: 
    
      - 1 time: compute the hash code of the key
      - 7 times: find the next node through the sub-node array. This is in 
        essence computation of an index with bit operations, followed by a
        memory read. The reason this is done at max 7 times is that it consumes
        5 bits of the hash code every time. With 32 bit hash codes, we have 6 5-bit
        quantities that can range from 0 to 31, while the last 5-bit quantity has
        only 2 significant bits, the other ones are always zero. The hashmapped nodes
        at the 7th level of the map will consequently have at most 4 sub-nodes.
        (Note that this is an intrinsic limit that is 
        determined by the hash code bit size, *not* by the algorithm.
        Should later Java versions choose to provide 'Long' bitcodes, for example,
        this code will still work with marginal adjustments, 
        just that there would be 13 levels of bitmapped nodes instead of 7.)
      - _n_ times: comparison with the keys in the collision list, where _n_
        is the number of elements of the collision list, or comparison with the
        key of a key/value node (this is equivalent to a collision list of length 1).

    It turns out that - absent hash collisions - lookups will be done almost in 
    *constant time*. 
    And so will be inserts and deletes, although with a slightly larger constant
    factor due to the house-keeping necessary for a persistent data structure. 
    However, even this are in the worst case 7 array copies, where 6 of them may
    be of size 32 and one of size 4. Assuming that the pointers are 4 bytes long, 
    this amounts to copying at most 196*4 bytes of memory. 

    The map can have at most 2^32 non-bitmapped nodes maintained in
    1+32+1024+32768+1048576+33554432+1073741824 bitmapped nodes. 
    But because collision lists can be arbitrary long, 
    the total number of key/value pairs is *not limited*.

        Reverse list while filtering out some key.

        Consider a collision list @[("foo", n), ("...", m)]@ in a word counting application.
        Assume that "foo" occurs many times, while "..." occurs just once.
        So if we would re-compute the collision list with
        > ("foo", n+1) : filter (!="foo")
        we would get
        > ("foo", n+1) : ("...", m) : filter (!="foo") []
        because 'filter' is lazy in the tail. The next time "foo" occurs, we would get
        > ("foo", n+1+1) : ("...", m) : filter (!="foo") (filter (!="foo") [])
        thus building up thunks. In the end, this breaks down on operations like
        'size', 'keys', 'values', 'each' ... etc. because the wrapped up filters will have
        to get evaluated, and a stack overflow may happen.
