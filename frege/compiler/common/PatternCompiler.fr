    Code for compiling efficient pattern matches for functions with
    multi equation definitions with more than a single pattern.

    This used to be done like 

    >                                case (a,b,c) of
    > f a1 b1 c1 = e1                   (a1,b1,c1) -> e1
    > f a2 b2 c2 = e2                   (a2,b2,c2) -> e2

    and the code generator has facilities to generate code for matching that 
    wouldn't construct/deconstruct the tuple.

    But this approach fails when there are higher rank function arguments, since using
    them as tuple elements would instantiate them, and thus ruin their higher rankedness.

    Canonicalize a pattern for the purpose of the pattern compiler.

    When we have

    > case u of pat -> ex

    but we want _pat_ to be a variable 'PVar', a 'PLit' or a constructor 'PCon'.
    For our purpose, 'PMat' counts as a special form of 'PLit' 

    We can achieve this by transforming like this, where @v@ resembles a new name.

    > p@pat  → ex                               cononicPatEx u pat (ex[p/u])
    > !p     → ex                               canonicPatEx u v | !p ← v          = ex,   if trimmed p is a variable

    Find case expressions of the form

    > case (u1, ...., un) of
    >    (a1, ..., an) -> e1
    >    (b1, ..., bn) -> e1

    and remove the construction/deconstruction of the tuples.

    This is important to do before typechecking, as the following example shows:

    > foo :: (forall a b.[a] → [b]) -> [c] -> [d] -> ([e],[f])
    > foo f [] ys = ([], f ys)
    > foo f xs [] = (f xs, [])      -- error: xs :: [c], expected [e]

    Because in the @Fix@ pass, all the arguments of an equation are stuffed in a tuple,
    we get a structure like above. But this instantiates the higher rank function and
    thus we get the error. See also 'https://github.com/Frege/frege/issues/273 Issue 273'

    This will work for all case expressions that scrutinize a product constructor
    (not just tuples) when the constructor is applied to variables only.

                            Here come the non-uniform cases.
                            Non-uniform means we have a bunch of constructors or literals
                            and at least one variable (or underscore, which is just an anonymous variable).
                            This tends to generate more complex code, and what is worse, 
                            the generated code may trigger unjustified "incomplete pattern" warnings.
                            
                            For example:
                            
                                general Nothing  []    = 42
                                general _        (_:_) = 43
                                general (Just _) []    = 44
                            
                            will generate:
                            
                                general a b = case a of 
                                    Nothing | []  ← b   = 42
                                    _   | _:_ ← b   = 43
                                        | otherwise = case a of
                                                        Just _ → case b of [] -> 44
                            
                            which works for the most general case. However, in the process the 
                            knowledge that the first argument cannot be Nothing anymore in the
                            3rd equation has been lost.
                            Hence you get a warning on the 3rd equation that Nothing is missing.
                            And in addition you get a warning that (_:_) is missing, though this
                            would have been catched by the 2nd equation, too.
                            
                            However, we can generate good code that doesn't trigger unjustified 
                            "incomplete pattern" warnings in several cases nonetheless:
                            
                            1. when the constructor reveals that we have a product type. then we can 
                               replace all the variables with that same constructor with all the 
                               subpatterns as underscores, i.e. in
                               
                                  tuple (1,x) (_:_) = x
                                  tuple _     _     = 42
                               the second clause becomes:
                                  tuple (_,_) _     = 42
                               and then this can be handled by the constructor rule.
                               
                            2. We cannot reorder clauses, since then the result of the program may
                               be difficult. But we can relax the left to right rule, since it will
                               invariably find the same right hand side (if any) than strict left to
                               right matching. However, what could change is the strictness of the 
                               function. Take for example the function "general" from above.
                               With strict left to right matching, it would be strict in the first 
                               argument since we need to check whether it is Nothing. That is, the
                               application
                                    general undefined [1,2,3]
                               would be undefined. However, consider the almost equivalent function
                               
                                   lareneg []    Nothing  = 42
                                   lareneg (_:_) _        = 43
                                   lareneg []    (Just _) = 44
                            
                               Now we can reorder the equations (since the first patterns are all refutable):
                               
                                   lareneg []    Nothing  = 42
                                   lareneg []    (Just _) = 44
                                   lareneg (_:_) _        = 43
                            
                               It becomes quite clear that the patterns are indeed complete. Anyway, if we
                               let
                               
                                    general' a b = lareneg b a
                               
                               we see that the application
                                    general' undefined [1,2,3]
                               is now 43, since the second argument will be checked first and then there
                               is no need to evaluate the first argument.
                               
                               Because we can generate much better code and avoid incomplete 
                               pattern warnings for function "lareneg" we will check the patterns in a 
                               further right column first, when that row is uniform but the 
                               first row is not, UNLESS the compiler option "-strict-pats" 
                               is in effect. 
                               We'll also give a hint about it, so the user can
