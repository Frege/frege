    Math functions from 
    'http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html java.lang.Math'.
    Many of those functions are overloaded for 'Float' and 'Double', so we 
    introduce a type class 'Floating' to avoid overloading issues.

    For example
    > f x = 2 * sqrt x
    would give a type error, because the compiler wouldn't know whether to use 
    > sqrt :: Float  -> Double
    or
    > sqrt :: Double -> Double

    Note that many functions return 'Double', no matter if the argument was 'Double' or
    'Float'.
