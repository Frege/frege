{--
    This package provides the 'Monad' class and related classes and functions.
    
    The class hierarchy is derived from the (Haskell) proposal */The Other Prelude/*
    but the traditional method names have been kept, except for 'Applicative'._*pure*_
    which is replaced by 'return'. This is because *@pure@* cannot be a function name in Frege
    due to being a keyword.
    
    The functions in this library use the following naming conventions:
    - A postfix "M"" always stands for a function in the Kleisli category: The monad type constructor _m_ is
      added to function results (modulo currying) and nowhere else. So, for example,
    > filter ::               (a -> Bool) -  > [a] -> [a]
    > filterM :: (Monad m) => (a -> m Bool) -> [a] -> m [a]
    - A postfix "_" changes the result type from (/m a/) to (/m ()/). Thus, for example:
    > sequence  :: Monad m => [m a] -> m [a]
    > sequence_ :: Monad m => [m a] -> m ()
    - A prefix "m" generalizes an existing function to a monadic form. Thus, for example:
    > sum :: Num a => [a] -> a
    > msum :: MonadPlus m => [m a] -> m a    
    
    This package is /implementation specific/ insofar as the compiler may
    assume that certain items are defined here in a certain way.
    Changes may thus lead to compiler crashes or java code that 
    will be rejected by the java compiler.
    
    In particular, desugared *@do@* expressions will reference 'Monad', '>>=' and '>>'.
    
    This package is implicitly imported and besides the additional stuff covers most of what
    one would get by importing _Control.Monad_ in Hasekll.

{--
    A functor with application, providing operations to

    - embed pure expressions ('return'), and
    - sequence computations and combine their results ('<*>').

    A minimal complete definition must include implementations of these
    functions satisfying the following laws:

    [/identity/]
        @return id <*> v = v@

    [/composition/]
        @return (•) <*> u <*> v <*> w = u <*> (v <*> w)@

    [/homomorphism/]
        @return f <*> return x = return (f x)@

    [/interchange/]
        @u <*> return y = return ($ y) <*> u@
  
    The other methods have the following default definitions, which may
    be overridden with equivalent specialized implementations:

    >  u *> v = return (const id)  <*> u <*> v
    >  u <* v = return const <*> u <*> v

    As a consequence of these laws, the 'Functor' instance for @f@ will satisfy
    > fmap f x = return f <*> x


    If @f@ is also a 'Monad', it should satisfy 
    @(<*>) = ap@ (which implies that 'return' and '<*>' satisfy the
    applicative functor laws).
    
    Minimal complete definition: 'return' and '<*>'.

{--
    The 'Monad' class defines the basic operations over a _monad_, 
    a concept from a branch of mathematics known as /category theory/. 
    From the perspective of a Frege programmer, however, it is best to think
    of a monad as an /abstract datatype/ of actions. 

    Frege’s *@do@* expressions provide a convenient syntax for writing monadic expressions.

    Instances of Monad should satisfy the following laws:

    > return a >>= k == k a
    > m >>= return == m
    > m >>= (\x -> k x >>= h) == (m >>= k) >>= h

    Since instances of 'Monad' are also instances of 'Functor', 
    they additionally shall satisfy the law:

    > fmap f xs == xs >>= return • f
    
    which is also the default implementation of 'fmap'.
    
    The instances of 'Monad' for lists, 'Maybe' and 'ST' defined in the Prelude
    satisfy these laws.
